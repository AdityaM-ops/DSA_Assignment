Problem Statement: Merge Two Sorted Arrays Without Extra Space
we are given two sorted arrays, arr1 of size n and arr2 of size m. The goal is to merge both arrays without using extra space, such that after merging:

The first n smallest elements should be in arr1.

The remaining m elements should be in arr2.

Both arr1 and arr2 should remain sorted after merging.

Constraints:
The function should run in O(n*m) or better.

No extra space should be used (i.e., merging should be done in-place).

The input arrays are already sorted in non-decreasing order.
