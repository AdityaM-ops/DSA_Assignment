Problem Statement: String Rotation Check
You are given two strings, s1 and s2. Write a function to determine whether s2 is a rotation of s1. A string s2 is considered a rotation of s1 if it can be obtained by shifting characters of s1 circularly while preserving their order.

Constraints:
The function should return True if s2 is a rotation of s1, otherwise return False.

The function should handle case-sensitive strings.

You may not use any additional data structures except strings.

The function should run efficiently.
